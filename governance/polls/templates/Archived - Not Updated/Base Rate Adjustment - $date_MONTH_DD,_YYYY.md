# Poll: Base Rate Adjustment - $date_MONTH_DD,_YYYY

The Governance Facilitators have placed a governance poll into the voting system which presents several possible **Base Rate** options. Voters are now able to signal their support for a **Base Rate** within a range of $lower_bound to $upper_bound.

Stability Fees are calculated from the Base Rate and Risk Premiums using the formula `Stability Fee = max(Base Rate + Risk Premium, 0%)`. **Please note that a negative Base Rate does NOT imply negative Stability Fees**.

## Review

The **Base Rate** is usually not discussed explicitly on a weekly basis as this poll is a regular occurrence. Please review the [governance forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/governance) to see if there has been any discussion on the vote this week to inform your position before voting.

## Next Steps

If the winning result of this poll differs from the current **Base Rate** parameter value in the Velero Protocol then this change will be included in the Executive Vote on the Friday following the conclusion of this poll.
